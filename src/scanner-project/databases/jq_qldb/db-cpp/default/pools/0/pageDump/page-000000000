   since version 4.9.  Previous versions do not provide generic
   selection, even though they might set __STDC_VERSION__ to 201112L,
   when in -std=c11 mode.  Thus, we must check for !defined __GNUC__
   when testing __STDC_VERSION__ for generic selection support.
   On the other hand, Clang also defines __GNUC__, so a clang-specific
   check is required to enable the use of generic selection.  *//* __glibc_macro_warning (MESSAGE) issues warning MESSAGE.  This is

   GCC 3.1 supports this.  *//* Ignore *//* __restrict is known in EGCS 1.2 and above. *//* It is possible to compile containing GCC extensions even if GCC is
   run in pedantic mode if the uses are carefully marked using the
   `__extension__' keyword.  But this is not generally available before
   version 2.8.  *//* GCC 4.3 and above allow passing all anonymous arguments of an
   __extern_always_inline function to some other vararg function.  *//* GCC 4.3 and above with -std=c99 or -std=gnu99 implements ISO C99
   inline semantics, unless -fgnu89-inline is used.  Using __GNUC_STDC_INLINE__
   or __GNUC_GNU_INLINE is not a good enough check for gcc because gcc versions
   older than 4.3 may define these macros and still not guarantee GNU inlining
   semantics.

   clang++ identifies itself as gcc-4.2, but has support for GNU inlining
   semantics, that can be checked for by using the __GNUC_STDC_INLINE_ and
   __GNUC_GNU_INLINE__ macro definitions.  *//* Associate error messages with the source location of the call site rather
   than with the source location inside the function.  *//* The Linux kernel defines __always_inline in stddef.h (283d7573), and
   it conflicts with this definition.  Therefore undefine it first to
   allow either header to be included first.  *//* Forces a function to be always inlined.  *//* empty *//* If fortification mode, we warn about unused results of certain
   function calls which can lead to problems.  *//* The nonull function attribute allows to mark pointer parameters which
   must not be NULL.  *//* At some point during the gcc 2.97 development the `strfmon' format
   attribute for functions was introduced.  We don't want to use it
   unconditionally (although this would be possible) since it
   generates warnings.  *//* At some point during the gcc 2.8 development the `format_arg' attribute
   for functions was introduced.  We don't want to use it unconditionally
   (although this would be possible) since it generates warnings.
   If several `format_arg' attributes are given for the same function, in
   gcc-3.0 and older, all but the last one are ignored.  In newer gccs,
   all designated arguments are considered.  *//* Since version 4.5, gcc also allows one to specify the message printed
   when a deprecated function is used.  clang claims to be gcc 4.2, but
   may also support this feature.  *//* Since version 3.2, gcc allows marking deprecated functions.  *//* At some point during the gcc 3.1 development the `used' attribute
   for functions was introduced.  We don't want to use it unconditionally
   (although this would be possible) since it generates warnings.  *//* This declaration tells the compiler that the value is constant.  *//* At some point during the gcc 2.96 development the `pure' attribute
   for functions was introduced.  We don't want to use it unconditionally
   (although this would be possible) since it generates warnings.  *//* Tell the compiler which arguments to an allocation function
   indicate the size of the allocation.  *//* At some point during the gcc 2.96 development the `malloc' attribute
   for functions was introduced.  We don't want to use it unconditionally
   (although this would be possible) since it generates warnings.  *//* GCC has various useful declarations that can be made with the
   `__attribute__' syntax.  All of the ways we use this do fine if
   they are omitted for compilers that don't understand it. *//*
#elif __SOME_OTHER_COMPILER__

# define __REDIRECT(name, proto, alias) name proto; \
	_Pragma("let " #name " = " #alias)
*//* __asm__ ("xyz") is used throughout the headers to rename functions
   at the assembly language level.  This is wrapped by the __REDIRECT
   macro, in order to support compilers that can do this some other
   way.  When compilers don't support asm-names at all, we have to do
   preprocessor tricks instead (which don't have exactly the right
   semantics, but it's the best we can do).

   Example:
   int __REDIRECT(setpgrp, (__pid_t pid, __pid_t pgrp), setpgid); *//* Some other non-C99 compiler.  Approximate with [1].  *//* Pre-2.97 GCC did not support C99 flexible arrays but did have
   an equivalent extension with slightly different notation.  *//* GCC 2.97 supports C99 flexible array members as an extension,
   even when in C89 mode or compiling C++ (any version).  *//* Support for flexible arrays.
   Headers that should use flexible arrays only if they're "real"
   (e.g. only if they won't affect sizeof()) should test
   #if __glibc_c99_flexarr_available.  *//* Use __builtin_dynamic_object_size at _FORTIFY_SOURCE=3 when available.  *//* Fortify support.  *//* C++ needs to know that types and declarations are C, not C++.  *//* This is not a typedef so `const __ptr_t' does the right thing.  *//* For these things, GCC behaves the ANSI way normally,
   and the non-ANSI way under -traditional.  *//* These two macros are not used in glibc anymore.  They are kept here
   only because some other projects expect the macros to be defined.  *//* Compilers that are not clang may object to
       #if defined __clang__ && __has_extension(...)
   even though they do not need to evaluate the right-hand side of the &&.  *//* GCC.  *//* No inline functions.  *//* Not GCC.  *//* GCC can always grok prototypes.  For C++ programs we add throw()
   to help it optimize the function calls.  But this only works with
   gcc 2.8.x and egcs.  For gcc 3.2 and up we even mark C functions
   as non-throwing using a function attribute since programs can use
   the -fexceptions options for C code as well.  *//* All functions, except those with callbacks or those that
   synchronize memory, are leaf functions.  *//* Some user header file might have defined this before.  *//* The GNU libc does not support any K&R compilers or the traditional mode
   of ISO C compilers anymore.  Check for some of the combinations not
   supported anymore.  *//* We are almost always included from features.h. *//* Copyright (C) 1992-2021 Free Software Foundation, Inc.

   For historic reasons the value now is 6 and this will stay from now
   on.  The use of this variable is deprecated.  Use __GLIBC__ and
   __GLIBC_MINOR__ now (see below) when you want to test for a specific
   GNU C library version and use the values in <gnu/lib-names.h> to get
   the sonames of the shared libraries.  *//* Get definitions of __STDC_* predefined macros, if the compiler has

   specifiers %as, %aS, and %a[...] that allocate a buffer for the
   input using malloc.  This extension conflicts with ISO C99, which
   defines %a as a standalone format specifier that reads a floating-
   point number; moreover, POSIX.1-2008 provides the same feature
   using the modifier letter 'm' instead (%ms, %mS, %m[...]).

   We now follow C99 unless GNU extensions are active and the compiler
   is specifically in C89 or C++98 mode (strict or not).  For
   instance, with GCC, -std=gnu11 will have C99-compliant scanf with
   or without -D_GNU_SOURCE, but -std=c89 -D_GNU_SOURCE will have the
   old extension.  *//* The function 'gets' existed in C89, but is impossible to use
   safely.  It has been removed from ISO C11 and ISO C++14.  Note: for
   compatibility with various implementations of <cstdio>, this test
   must consider only the value of __cplusplus when compiling C++.  *//* Some C libraries once required _REENTRANT and/or _THREAD_SAFE to be
   defined in all multithreaded code.  GNU libc has not required this
   for many years.  We now treat them as compatibility synonyms for
   _POSIX_C_SOURCE=199506L, which is the earliest level of POSIX with
   comprehensive support for multithreaded code.  Using them never
   lowers the selected level of POSIX conformance, only raises it.  *//* If none of the ANSI/POSIX macros are defined, or if _DEFAULT_SOURCE
   is defined, use POSIX.1-2008 (or another version depending on
   _XOPEN_SOURCE).  *//* This is to enable compatibility for ISO C++11.
   Check the temporary macro for now, too.  *//* This is to enable compatibility for ISO C++17.  *//* This is to enable the ISO C90 Amendment 1:1995 extension.  *//* This is to enable the ISO C99 extension.  *//* This is to enable the ISO C11 extension.  *//* This is to enable the ISO C2X extension.  *//* If nothing (other than _GNU_SOURCE and _DEFAULT_SOURCE) is defined,

   _DEFAULT_SOURCE.  If _DEFAULT_SOURCE is present we do not
   issue a warning; the expectation is that the source is being
   transitioned to use the new macro.  *//* Whether to use feature set F.  *//* Similarly for clang.  Features added to GCC after version 4.2 may
   or may not also be available in clang, and clang's definitions of
   __GNUC(_MINOR)__ are fixed at 4 and 2 respectively.  Not all such
   features can be queried via __has_extension/__has_feature.  *//* Convenience macro to test the version of gcc.
   Use like this:

   ... code requiring gcc 2.8 or later ...

   Note: only works for GCC 2.0 and later, because __GNUC_MINOR__ was

			Set to 1 or 2; 2 performs stricter checks than 1.

   _REENTRANT, _THREAD_SAFE
			Obsolete; equivalent to _POSIX_C_SOURCE=199506L.

   The `-ansi' switch to the GNU C compiler, and standards conformance
   options such as `-std=c99', define __STRICT_ANSI__.  If none of
   these are defined, or if _DEFAULT_SOURCE is defined, the default is
   to have _POSIX_SOURCE set to one and _POSIX_C_SOURCE set to
   200809L, as well as enabling miscellaneous functions from BSD and
   SVID.  If more than one of these are defined, they accumulate.  For
   example __STRICT_ANSI__, _POSIX_SOURCE and _POSIX_C_SOURCE together
   give you ISO C, 1003.1, and 1003.2, but nothing else.

   These are defined by this file and are used by the
   header files to decide what to declare or define:

   __GLIBC_USE (F)	Define things from feature set F.  This is defined
			to 1 or 0; the subsequent macros are either defined
			or undefined, and those tests should be moved to
			__GLIBC_USE.
   __USE_ISOC11		Define ISO C11 things.
   __USE_ISOC99		Define ISO C99 things.
   __USE_ISOC95		Define ISO C90 AMD1 (C95) things.
   __USE_ISOCXX11	Define ISO C++11 things.
   __USE_POSIX		Define IEEE Std 1003.1 things.
   __USE_POSIX2		Define IEEE Std 1003.2 things.
   __USE_POSIX199309	Define IEEE Std 1003.1, and .1b things.
   __USE_POSIX199506	Define IEEE Std 1003.1, .1b, .1c and .1i things.
   __USE_XOPEN		Define XPG things.
   __USE_XOPEN_EXTENDED	Define X/Open Unix things.
   __USE_UNIX98		Define Single Unix V2 things.
   __USE_XOPEN2K        Define XPG6 things.
   __USE_XOPEN2KXSI     Define XPG6 XSI things.
   __USE_XOPEN2K8       Define XPG7 things.
   __USE_XOPEN2K8XSI    Define XPG7 XSI things.
   __USE_LARGEFILE	Define correct standard I/O things.
   __USE_LARGEFILE64	Define LFS things with separate names.
   __USE_FILE_OFFSET64	Define 64bit interface as default.
   __USE_MISC		Define things from 4.3BSD or System V Unix.
   __USE_ATFILE		Define *at interfaces and AT_* constants for them.
   __USE_GNU		Define GNU extensions.
   __USE_FORTIFY_LEVEL	Additional security measures used, according to level.

   The macros `__GNU_LIBRARY__', `__GLIBC__', and `__GLIBC_MINOR__' are
   defined by this file unconditionally.  `__GNU_LIBRARY__' is provided
   only for compatibility.  All new code should use the other symbols
   to test for features.

   All macros listed above as possibly being defined by this file are
   explicitly undefined if they are not explicitly defined.
   Feature-test macros that are not defined by the user or compiler
   but are implied by the other feature-test macros defined (or by the
   lack of any definitions) are defined by the file.

   ISO C feature test macros depend on the definition of the macro
   when an affected header is included, not when the first system
   header is included, and so they are handled in
   <bits/libc-header-start.h>, which does not have a multiple include
   guard.  Feature test macros that can be handled from the first
   system header included are handled here.  *//usr/include/bits/timesize.htimesize__TIMESIZE/* For others, time size is word size.  *//* For x32, time is 64-bit even though word size is 32-bit.  *//* Bit size of the time_t type at glibc build time, x86-64 and x32 case.

   macros for each of the OS types we define below.  The definitions
   of those macros must use the following macros for underlying types.
   We define __S<SIZE>_TYPE and __U<SIZE>_TYPE for the signed and unsigned
   variants of each of the following integer types on this machine.

	16		-- "natural" 16-bit type (always short)
	32		-- "natural" 32-bit type (always int)
	64		-- "natural" 64-bit type (long or long long)
	LONG32		-- 32-bit type, traditionally long
	QUAD		-- 64-bit type, traditionally long long
	WORD		-- natural type of __WORDSIZE bits (int or long)
	LONGWORD	-- type of __WORDSIZE bits, traditionally long

   We distinguish WORD/LONGWORD, 32/LONG32, and 64/QUAD so that the
   conventional uses of `long' or `long long' type modifiers match the
   types we define, even when a less-adorned type would be the same size.
   This matters for (somewhat) portably writing printf/scanf formats for
   these types, where using the appropriate l or ll format modifiers can
   make the typedefs and the formats match up across all GNU platforms.  If
   we used `long' when it's 64 bits where `long long' is expected, then the
   compiler would warn about the formats not matching the argument types,
   and the programmer changing them to shut up the compiler would break the
   program's portability.

   Here we assume what is presently the case in all the GCC configurations
   we support: long long is always 64 bits, long is always word/address size,
   and int is always 32 bits.  *//* Largest integral types.  *//* quad_t is also 64 bits.  *//* Smallest types with at least a given width.  *//* Fixed-size types, underlying types depend on word size and compiler.  *//* Convenience types.  *//*
 * Never include this file directly; use <sys/types.h> instead.
 *//* bits/types.h -- definitions of __*_t types underlying *_t types.

   __SIZEOF_PTHREAD_BARRIER_T     - size of pthread_barrier_t.
   __SIZEOF_PTHREAD_BARRIERATTR_T - size of pthread_barrierattr_t.

   The additional macro defines any constraint for the lock alignment
   inside the thread structures:

   __LOCK_ALIGNMENT - for internal lock/futex usage.

   __ONCE_ALIGNMENT - for pthread_once_t/once_flag definition.  *//* Common threading primitives definitions for both POSIX and C11.

   The declarations here must match those in localeinfo.h.

   In the thread-specific locale model (see `uselocale' in <locale.h>)
   we cannot use global variables for these as was done in the past.
   Instead, the following accessor functions return the address of
   each variable, which is local to the current thread if multithreaded.

   These point into arrays of 384, so they can be indexed by any `unsigned
   char' value [0,255]; by EOF (-1); or by any `signed char' value
   [-128,-1).  ISO C requires that the ctype functions work for `unsigned
   char' values and for EOF; we also support negative `signed char' values
   for broken old programs.  The case conversion arrays are of `int's
   rather than `unsigned char's because tolower (EOF) must be EOF, which
   doesn't fit into an `unsigned char'.  But today more important is that
   the arrays are also used for multi-byte character sets.  *//* ! _ISbit  *//* Alphanumeric.  *//* Punctuation.  *//* Control character.  *//* Blank (usually SPC and TAB).  *//* Graphical.  *//* Printing.  *//* Whitespace.  *//* Hexadecimal numeric.  *//* Numeric.  *//* Alphabetic.  *//* lowercase.  *//* UPPERCASE.  *//* __BYTE_ORDER == __LITTLE_ENDIAN *//* These are all the characteristics of characters.
   If there get to be more than 16 distinct characteristics,
   many things must be changed that use `unsigned short int's.

   The characteristics are stored always in network byte order (big
   endian).  We define the bit value interpretations here dependent on the
   machine's byte order.  *//*

 *//usr/include/bits/uio_lim.huio_lim__IOV_MAX_BITS_UIO_LIM_H/* Maximum length of the 'struct iovec' array in a single call to
   readv or writev.

   This macro has different values in different kernel versions.  The
   latest versions of the kernel use 1024 and this is good choice.  Since
   the C library implementation of readv/writev is able to emulate the
   functionality even if the currently running kernel does not support
   this large value the readv/writev call will not fail because of this.  *//* Implementation limits related to sys/uio.h - Linux version.

   This file provides prototype declarations for the math functions.
   Most functions are declared using the macro:

   __MATHCALL (NAME,[_r], (ARGS...));

   This means there is a function `NAME' returning `double' and a function
   `NAMEf' returning `float'.  Each place `_Mdouble_' appears in the
   prototype, that is actually `double' in the prototype for `NAME' and
   `float' in the prototype for `NAMEf'.  Reentrant variant functions are
   called `NAME_r' and `NAMEf_r'.

   Functions returning other types like `int' are declared using the macro:

   __MATHDECL (TYPE, NAME,[_r], (ARGS...));

   This is just like __MATHCALL but for a function returning `TYPE'
   instead of `_Mdouble_'.  In all of these cases, there is still
   both a `NAME' and a `NAMEf' that takes `float' arguments.

   Note that there must be no whitespace before the argument passed for
   NAME, to make token pasting work with -traditional.  *//* Prototype declarations for math functions; helper file for <math.h>.

128-bit long double, _Float128 is defined as long double
     in C++.  *//* In C++ mode, __MATH_TG cannot be used, because it relies on
   __builtin_types_compatible_p, which is a C-only builtin.  Moreover,
   the comparison macros from ISO C take two floating-point arguments,
   which need not have the same type.  Choosing what underlying function
   to call requires evaluating the formats of the arguments, then
   selecting which is wider.  The macro __MATH_EVAL_FMT2 provides this
   information, however, only the type of the macro expansion is
   relevant (actually evaluating the expression would be incorrect).
   Thus, the type is used as a template parameter for __iseqsig_type,
   which calls the appropriate underlying function.  *//* Return X == Y but raising "invalid" and setting errno if X or Y is
   a NaN.  *//* An expression whose type has the widest of the evaluation formats
   of X and Y (which are of floating-point types).  *//* isunordered must always check both operands first for signaling NaNs.  *//* ISO C99 defines some macros to compare number while taking care for
   unordered numbers.  Many FPUs provide special instructions to support
   these operations.  Generic support in GCC for these as builtins went
   in 2.97, but not all cpus added their patterns until 3.1.  Therefore
   we enable the builtins from 3.1 onwards and use a generic implementation
   othwerwise.  *//* 1/sqrt(2) *//* sqrt(2) *//* 2/sqrt(pi) *//* 2/pi *//* 1/pi *//* pi/4 *//* pi/2 *//* pi *//* log_e 10 *//* log_e 2 *//* log_10 e *//* log_2 e *//* e *//* The above constants are not adequate for computation using `long double's.
   Therefore we provide as an extension constants with similar names as a
   GNU extension.  Provide enough digits for the 128-bit IEEE quad.  *//* Some useful constants.  *//* X/Open wants another strange constant.  *//* extern C++ *//* Return nonzero value if X is zero.  *//* Return nonzero value if X is subnormal.  *//* When using an IEEE 128-bit long double, _Float128 is defined as long double
   in C++.  *//* In C++ mode, __MATH_TG cannot be used, because it relies on
      __builtin_types_compatible_p, which is a C-only builtin.  On the
      other hand, overloading provides the means to distinguish between
      the floating-point types.  The overloading resolution will match
      the correct parameter (regardless of type qualifiers (i.e.: const
      and volatile)).  *//* Return nonzero value if X is a signaling NaN.  *//* By default all math functions support both errno and exception handling
   (except for soft floating point implementations which may only support
   errno handling).  If errno handling is disabled, exceptions are still
   supported by GLIBC.  Set math_errhandling to 0 with -ffast-math (this is
   nonconforming but it is more useful than leaving it undefined).  *//* Exceptions raised by math functions.  *//* errno set by math functions.  *//* Bitmasks for the math_errhandling macro.  *//* Since __builtin_isinf_sign is broken for float128 before GCC 7.0,
      use the helper function, __isinff128, with older compilers.  This is
      only provided for C mode, because in C++ mode, GCC has no support
      for __builtin_types_compatible_p (and when in C++ mode, this macro is
      not used anyway, because libstdc++ headers undefine it).  *//* Return nonzero value if X is positive or negative infinity.  *//* Return nonzero value if X is a NaN.  We could use `fpclassify' but
   we already have this functions `__isnan' and it is faster.  *//* Return nonzero value if X is neither zero, subnormal, Inf, nor NaN.  *//* Return nonzero value if X is not +-Inf or NaN.  *//* In C++ mode, __MATH_TG cannot be used, because it relies on
     __builtin_types_compatible_p, which is a C-only builtin.
     The check for __cplusplus allows the use of the builtin instead of
     __MATH_TG. This is provided for libstdc++, only to let its configure
     test work. No further use of this definition of signbit is expected
     in C++ mode, since libstdc++ provides its own version of signbit
     in cmath (which undefines signbit). *//* Return nonzero value if sign of X is negative.  *//* The check for __cplusplus allows the use of the builtin, even
	when optimization for size is on.  This is provided for
	libstdc++, only to let its configure test work when it is built
	with -Os.  No further use of this definition of fpclassify is
	expected in C++ mode, since libstdc++ provides its own version
	of fpclassify in cmath (which undefines fpclassify).  *//* Return number of classification appropriate for X.  *//* GCC bug 66462 means we cannot use the math builtins with -fsignaling-nan,
   so disable builtins if this is enabled.  When fixed in a newer GCC,
   the __SUPPORT_SNAN__ check may be skipped for those versions.  *//* All floating-point numbers can be put in one of these categories.  *//* ISO C99 defines some generic macros which work on any data type.  *//* Depending on the type of TG_ARG, call an appropriately suffixed
   version of FUNC with arguments (including parentheses) ARGS.
   Suffixed functions may not exist for long double if it has the same
   format as double, or for other types with the same format as float,
   double or long double.  The behavior is undefined if the argument
   does not have a real floating type.  The definition may use a
   conditional expression, so all suffixed versions of FUNC must
   return the same type (FUNC may include a cast if necessary rather
   than being a single identifier).  *//* This variable is used by `gamma' and `lgamma'.  *//* Declare functions returning a narrower type.  *//* __HAVE_DISTINCT_FLOAT128X || (__HAVE_FLOAT128X && !_LIBC).  *//* __HAVE_DISTINCT_FLOAT64X || (__HAVE_FLOAT64X && !_LIBC).  *//* __HAVE_DISTINCT_FLOAT32X || (__HAVE_FLOAT32X && !_LIBC).  *//* __HAVE_DISTINCT_FLOAT128 || (__HAVE_FLOAT128 && !_LIBC).  *//* __HAVE_DISTINCT_FLOAT64 || (__HAVE_FLOAT64 && !_LIBC).  *//* __HAVE_DISTINCT_FLOAT32 || (__HAVE_FLOAT32 && !_LIBC).  *//* __HAVE_DISTINCT_FLOAT16 || (__HAVE_FLOAT16 && !_LIBC).  *//* Include the file of declarations for _FloatN and _FloatNx

   arguments in ARGV (ARGC of them, minus the program name) for
   options given in OPTS.

   Return the option character from OPTS just read.  Return -1 when
   there are no more options.  For unrecognized options, or options
   missing arguments, 'optopt' is set to the option letter, and '?' is
   returned.

   The OPTS string is a list of characters which are recognized option
   letters, optionally followed by colons, specifying that that letter
   takes an argument, to be placed in 'optarg'.

   If a letter in OPTS is followed by two colons, its argument is
   optional.  This behavior is specific to the GNU 'getopt'.

   The argument '--' causes premature termination of argument
   scanning, explicitly telling 'getopt' that there are no more
   options.

   If OPTS begins with '-', then non-option arguments are treated as
   arguments to the option '\1'.  This behavior is specific to the GNU
   'getopt'.  If OPTS begins with '+', or POSIXLY_CORRECT is set in
   the environment, then do not permute arguments.

   For standards compliance, the 'argv' argument has the type
   char *const *, but this is inaccurate; if argument permutation is
   enabled, the argv array (not the strings it points to) must be
   writable.  *//* Set to an option character which was unrecognized.  *//* Callers store zero here to inhibit the error message 'getopt' prints
   for unrecognized options.  *//* Index in ARGV of the next element to be scanned.
   This is used for communication to and from the caller
   and for communication between successive calls to 'getopt'.

   On entry to 'getopt', zero means this is the first call; initialize.

   When 'getopt' returns -1, this is the index of the first of the
   non-option elements that the caller should itself scan.

   Otherwise, 'optind' communicates from one call to the next
   how much of ARGV has been scanned so far.  *//* For communication from 'getopt' to the caller.
   When 'getopt' finds an option that takes an argument,
   the argument value is returned here.
   Also, when 'ordering' is RETURN_IN_ORDER,
   each non-option ARGV-element is returned here.  *//* This header should not be used directly; include getopt.h or
   unistd.h instead.  Unlike most bits headers, it does not have
   a protective #error, because the guard macro for getopt.h in
   gnulib is not fixed.  *//* Declarations for getopt (basic, portable features only).

   This is completely system-dependent, and not often useful.

   In Unix, `syscall' sets `errno' for all errors and most calls return -1
   for errors; in many systems you cannot pass arguments or get return
   values for all system calls (`pipe', `fork', and `getppid' typically
   among them).

   In Mach, all system calls take normal arguments and always return an
   error code (zero for success).  *//* Increase or decrease the end of accessible data space by DELTA bytes.
   If successful, returns the address the previous end of data space
   (i.e. the beginning of the new space, if DELTA > 0);
   returns (void *) -1 for errors (with errno set).  *//* Set the end of accessible data space (aka "the break") to ADDR.
   Returns zero on success and -1 for errors (with errno set).  *//* Use POSIX.1b || X/Open Unix || XPG6.  *//* Truncate the file FD is open on to LENGTH bytes.  *//* Use X/Open Unix || POSIX 2008.  *//* Truncate FILE to LENGTH bytes.  *//* Use misc || X/Open Unix.  *//* Return the maximum number of file descriptors

   Uses /dev/tty if possible; otherwise stderr and stdin.  *//* Make PATH be the root directory (the starting point for absolute paths).
   This call is restricted to the super-user.  *//* Put the program in the background, and dissociate from the controlling
   terminal.  If NOCHDIR is zero, do `chdir ("/")'.  If NOCLOSE is zero,
   redirects stdin, stdout, and stderr to /dev/null.  *//* Rewind and re-read the file.  *//* Discard cached info.  *//* Successive calls return the shells listed in `/etc/shells'.  *//* Turn accounting on if NAME is an existing file.  The system will then write
   a record for each process as it terminates, to this file.  If NAME is NULL,
   turn accounting off.  This call is restricted to the super-user.  *//* Enable statistical profiling, writing samples of the PC into at most
   SIZE bytes of SAMPLE_BUFFER; every processor clock tick while profiling
   is enabled, the system examines the user PC and increments
   SAMPLE_BUFFER[((PC - OFFSET) / 2) * SCALE / 65536].  If SCALE is zero,
   disable profiling.  Returns zero on success, -1 on error.  *//* Revoke the access of all descriptors currently open on FILE.  *//* Revoke access permissions to all processes currently communicating
   with the control terminal, and then send a SIGHUP signal to the process
   group of the control terminal.  *//* Get and set the NIS (aka YP) domain name, if any.
   Called just like `gethostname' and `sethostname'.
   The NIS domain name is usually the empty string when not using NIS.  *//* Set the current machine's Internet number to ID.
   This call is restricted to the super-user.  *//* Set the name of the current host to NAME, which is LEN bytes long.
   This call is restricted to the super-user.  *//* Put the name of the current host in no more than LEN bytes of NAME.
   The result is null-terminated if LEN is large enough for the full
   name and the terminator.  *//* Get definitions and prototypes for functions to process the
   arguments in ARGV (ARGC of them, minus the program name) for
   options given in OPTS.  *//* Set the login name returned by `getlogin'.  *//* Return at most NAME_LEN characters of the login name of the user in NAME.
   If it cannot be determined or some other error occurred, return the error
   code.  Otherwise return 0.

   This function is a possible cancellation point and therefore not
   marked with __THROW.  *//* Return the login name of the user.

   This function is a possible cancellation point and therefore not
   marked with __THROW.  *//* Set the foreground process group ID of FD set PGRP_ID.  *//* Return the foreground process group ID of FD.  *//* Remove the directory PATH.  *//* Remove the link NAME relative to FD.  *//* Remove the link NAME.  *//* Like readlink but a relative PATH is interpreted relative to FD.  *//* Like symlink but a relative path in TO is interpreted relative to TOFD.  *//* Use POSIX.1-2001.  *//* Read the contents of the symbolic link PATH into no more than
   LEN bytes of BUF.  The contents are not null-terminated.
   Returns the number of characters read, or -1 for errors.  *//* Make a symbolic link to FROM named TO.  *//* Like link but relative paths in TO and FROM are interpreted relative
   to FROMFD and TOFD respectively.  *//* Make a link to FROM named TO.  *//* Return 1 if FD is a valid descriptor associated
   with a terminal, zero if not.  *//* Store at most BUFLEN characters of the pathname of the terminal FD is
   open on in BUF.  Return 0 on success, otherwise an error number.  *//* Return the pathname of the terminal FD is open on, or NULL on errors.
   The returned storage is good only until the next call to this function.  *//* Use misc or XPG < 7. *//* Clone the calling process, but without copying the whole address space.
   The calling process is suspended until the new process exits or is
   replaced by a call to `execve'.  Return -1 for errors, 0 to the new process,
   and the process ID of the new process to the old process.  *//* Clone the calling process, creating an exact copy.
   Return -1 for errors, 0 to the new process,
   and the process ID of the new process to the old process.  *//* Set the real group ID, effective group ID, and saved-set group ID,
   of the calling process to RGID, EGID, and SGID, respectively.  *//* Set the real user ID, effective user ID, and saved-set user ID,

   if not, the effective group ID is set to GID.  *//* Set the effective user ID of the calling process to UID.  *//* Set the real user ID of the calling process to RUID,
   and the effective user ID of the calling process to EUID.  *//* Set the user ID of the calling process to UID.
   If the calling process is the super-user, set the real
   and effective user IDs, and the saved set-user-ID to UID;
   if not, the effective user ID is set to UID.  *//* Return nonzero iff the calling process is in group GID.  *//* If SIZE is zero, return the number of supplementary groups
   the calling process is in.  Otherwise, fill in the group IDs
   of its supplementary groups in LIST and return the number written.  *//* Get the effective group ID of the calling process.  *//* Get the real group ID of the calling process.  *//* Get the effective user ID of the calling process.  *//* Get the real user ID of the calling process.  *//* Return the session ID of the given process.  *//* Create a new session with the calling process as its leader.
   The process group IDs of the session and the calling process
   are set to the process ID of the calling process, which is returned.  *//* Set the process group ID of the calling process to its own PID.
   This is exactly the same as `setpgid (0, 0)'.  *//* Both System V and BSD have `setpgrp' functions, but with different
   calling conventions.  The BSD function is the same as POSIX.1 `setpgid'
   (above).  The System V function takes no arguments and puts the calling
   process in its on group like `setpgid (0, 0)'.

   New programs should always use `setpgid' instead.

   GNU provides the POSIX.1 function.  *//* Set the process group ID of the process matching PID to PGID.
   If PID is zero, the current process's process group ID is set.
   If PGID is zero, the process ID of the process is used.  *//* Get the process group ID of process PID.  *//* Get the process group ID of the calling process.  *//* Get the process ID of the calling process's parent.  *//* Get the process ID of the calling process.  *//* Get the value of the string-valued system variable NAME.  *//* Get the value of the system variable NAME.  *//* Get file-specific configuration about descriptor FD.  *//* Get file-specific configuration information about PATH.  *//* Get the `_PC_*' symbols for the NAME argument to `pathconf' and `fpathconf';
   the `_SC_*' symbols for the NAME argument to `sysconf';
   and the `_CS_*' symbols for the NAME argument to `confstr'.  *//* Terminate program execution with the low-order 8 bits of STATUS.  *//* Add INC to priority of the current process.  *//* Execute FILE, searching in the `PATH' environment variable if it contains
   no slashes, with arguments ARGV and environment from `environ'.  *//* Execute FILE, searching in the `PATH' environment variable if
   it contains no slashes, with all arguments after FILE until a
   NULL pointer and environment from `environ'.  *//* Execute PATH with all arguments after PATH until
   a NULL pointer and environment from `environ'.  *//* Execute PATH with all arguments after PATH until a NULL pointer,
   and the argument after that for environment.  *//* Execute PATH with arguments ARGV and environment from `environ'.  *//* Execute the file FD refers to, overlaying the running program image.
   ARGV and ENVP are passed to the new program, as for `execve'.  *//* Replace the current process, executing PATH with arguments ARGV and
   environment ENVP.  ARGV and ENVP are terminated by NULL pointers.  *//* NULL-terminated array of "NAME=VALUE" environment variables.  *//* Duplicate FD to FD2, closing FD2 and making it open on the same
   file while setting flags according to FLAGS.  *//* Duplicate FD to FD2, closing FD2 and making it open on the same file.  *//* Duplicate FD, returning a new file descriptor on the same file.  *//* Put the absolute pathname of the current working directory in BUF.
   If successful, return BUF.  If not, put an error message in
   BUF and return NULL.  BUF should be at least PATH_MAX bytes long.  *//* Return a malloc'd string containing the current directory name.
   If the environment variable `PWD' is set, and its value is correct,
   that value is used.  *//* Get the pathname of the current working directory,
   and put it in SIZE bytes of BUF.  Returns NULL if the
   directory couldn't be determined or SIZE was too small.
   If successful, returns BUF.  In GNU, if BUF is NULL,
   an array is allocated with `malloc'; the array is SIZE
   bytes long, unless SIZE == 0, in which case it is as
   big as necessary.  *//* Change the process's working directory to the one FD is open on.  *//* Change the process's working directory to PATH.  *//* Change the owner and group of FILE relative to the directory FD is open
   on.  *//* Use X/Open Unix.  *//* Change owner and group of FILE, if it is a symbolic
   link the ownership of the symbolic link is changed.  *//* Change the owner and group of the file that FD is open on.  *//* Change the owner and group of FILE.  *//* Suspend the process until a signal arrives.
   This always returns -1 and sets `errno' to EINTR.

   This function is a cancellation point and therefore not marked with
   __THROW.  *//* Sleep USECONDS microseconds, or until a signal arrives that is not blocked
   or ignored.

   This function is a cancellation point and therefore not marked with
   __THROW.  *//* Set an alarm to go off (generating a SIGALRM signal) in VALUE
   microseconds.  If INTERVAL is nonzero, when the alarm goes off, the
   timer is reset to go off every INTERVAL microseconds thereafter.
   Returns the number of microseconds remaining before the alarm.  *//* Make the process sleep for SECONDS seconds, or until a signal arrives
   and is not ignored.  The function returns the number of seconds less
   than SECONDS which it actually slept (thus zero if it slept the full time).
   If a signal handler does a `longjmp' or modifies the handling of the
   SIGALRM signal while inside `sleep' call, the handling of the SIGALRM
   signal afterwards is undefined.  There is no return value to indicate
   error, but if `sleep' returns SECONDS, it probably didn't work.

   This function is a cancellation point and therefore not marked with
   __THROW.  *//* Schedule an alarm.  In SECONDS seconds, the process will get a SIGALRM.
   If SECONDS is zero, any currently scheduled alarm will be cancelled.
   The function returns the number of seconds remaining until the last
   alarm scheduled would have signaled, or zero if there wasn't one.
   There is no return value to indicate an error, but you can set `errno'
   to 0 and check its value after calling `alarm', and this might tell you.
   The signal may come late due to processor scheduling.  *//* Same as pipe but apply flags passed in FLAGS to the new file
   descriptors.  *//* Create a one-way communication channel (pipe).
   If successful, two file descriptors are stored in PIPEDES;
   bytes written on PIPEDES[1] can be read from PIPEDES[0].
   Returns 0 if successful, -1 if not.  *//* Write N bytes of BUF to FD at the given position OFFSET without
   changing the file pointer.  Return the number written, or -1.  *//* Read NBYTES into BUF from FD at the given position OFFSET without
   changing the file pointer.  Return the number read, -1 for errors
   or 0 for EOF.  *//* Write N bytes of BUF to FD at the given position OFFSET without
   changing the file pointer.  Return the number written, or -1.

   This function is a cancellation point and therefore not marked with
   __THROW.  *//* Read NBYTES into BUF from FD at the given position OFFSET without
   changing the file pointer.  Return the number read, -1 for errors
   or 0 for EOF.

   __THROW.  *//* Write N bytes of BUF to FD.  Return the number written, or -1.

   This function is a cancellation point and therefore not marked with
   __THROW.  *//* Read NBYTES into BUF from FD.  Return the
   number read, -1 for errors or 0 for EOF.

   This function is a cancellation point and therefore not marked with
   __THROW.  *//* Close the file descriptor FD.

   This function is a cancellation point and therefore not marked with
   __THROW.  *//* Move FD's file position to OFFSET bytes from the
   beginning of the file (if WHENCE is SEEK_SET),
   the current position (if WHENCE is SEEK_CUR),
   or the end of the file (if WHENCE is SEEK_END).
   Return the new file position.  *//* Old BSD names for the same constants; just for compatibility.  *//* <stdio.h> has the same definitions.  *//* Values for the WHENCE argument to lseek.  *//* Test for access to FILE relative to the directory FD is open on.
   If AT_EACCESS is set in FLAG, then use effective IDs like `eaccess',
   otherwise use real IDs like `access'.  *//* An alias for `euidaccess', used by some other systems.  *//* Test for access to NAME using the effective UID and GID
   (as normal file operations use).  *//* Test for access to NAME using the real UID and real GID.  *//* Test for existence.  *//* Test for execute permission.  *//* Test for write permission.  *//* Test for read permission.  *//* Values for the second argument to access.
   These may be OR'd together.  *//* X/Open *//* The Single Unix specification says that some more types are
   available here.  *//* All functions that are not declared anywhere else.  *//* Standard error output.  *//* Standard output.  *//* Standard input.  *//* Standard file descriptors.  *//* Get the environment definitions from Unix98.  *//* Get values of POSIX options:

   If these symbols are defined, the corresponding features are
   always available.  If not, they may be available sometimes.
   The current values can be obtained with `sysconf'.

  The intermediate representation for jq filters is as a sequence of
  struct inst, which form a doubly-linked list via the next and prev
  pointers.

  A "block" represents a sequence of "struct inst", which may be
  empty.

  Blocks are generated by the parser bottom-up, so may have free
  variables (refer to things not defined). See inst.bound_by and
  inst.symbol.

       * The level is a relative number of call frames reachable from
       * the currently one; 0 -> current frame, 1 -> previous frame, and
       * so on.

       * or of the closed frame's parameter closures.  If the latter,

   definitions of these values are generalised to include support for

   Prior to this (for C99/C11) the definitions were:

	-1  indeterminate
	 0  evaluate all operations and constants just to the range and
	    precision of the type
	 1  evaluate operations and constants of type float and double
	    to the range and precision of the double type, evaluate
	    long double operations and constants to the range and
	    precision of the long double type
	 2  evaluate all operations and constants to the range and
	    precision of the long double type

   The TS 18661-3 definitions are:

	-1  indeterminate
	 0  evaluate all operations and constants, whose semantic type has
	    at most the range and precision of float, to the range and
	    precision of float; evaluate all other operations and constants
	    to the range and precision of the semantic type.
	 1  evaluate all operations and constants, whose semantic type has
	    at most the range and precision of double, to the range and
	    precision of double; evaluate all other operations and constants
	    to the range and precision of the semantic type.
	 2  evaluate all operations and constants, whose semantic type has
	    at most the range and precision of long double, to the range and
	    precision of long double; evaluate all other operations and
	    constants to the range and precision of the semantic type.
	 N  where _FloatN  is a supported interchange floating type
	    evaluate all operations and constants, whose semantic type has
	    at most the range and precision of the _FloatN type, to the
	    range and precision of the _FloatN type; evaluate all other
	    operations and constants to the range and precision of the
	    semantic type.
	 N + 1, where _FloatNx is a supported extended floating type
	    evaluate operations and constants, whose semantic type has at
	    most the range and precision of the _FloatNx type, to the range
	    and precision of the _FloatNx type; evaluate all other
	    operations and constants to the range and precision of the
	    semantic type.

   The compiler predefines two macros:

      __FLT_EVAL_METHOD__
      Which, depending on the value given for
      -fpermitted-flt-eval-methods, may be limited to only those values
      for FLT_EVAL_METHOD defined in C99/C11.

     __FLT_EVAL_METHOD_TS_18661_3__
      Which always permits the values for FLT_EVAL_METHOD defined in
      ISO/IEC TS 18661-3.

     Here we want to use __FLT_EVAL_METHOD__, unless
     __STDC_WANT_IEC_60559_TYPES_EXT__ is defined, in which case the user
     is specifically asking for the ISO/IEC TS 18661-3 types, so we use
     __FLT_EVAL_METHOD_TS_18661_3__.

	mode:

			and rounded to nearest.
		1 ==> like 0, but with Steele & White stopping rule;
			e.g. with IEEE P754 arithmetic , mode 0 gives
			1e23 whereas mode 1 gives 9.999999999999999e22.
		2 ==> max(1,ndigits) significant digits.  This gives a
			return value similar to that of ecvt, except
			that trailing zeros are suppressed.
		3 ==> through ndigits past the decimal point.  This
			gives a return value similar to that from fcvt,
			except that trailing zeros are suppressed, and
			ndigits can be negative.
		4,5 ==> similar to 2 and 3, respectively, but (in
			round-nearest mode) with the tests of mode 0 to
			possibly return a shorter string that rounds to d.
			With IEEE arithmetic and compilation with
			-DHonor_FLT_ROUNDS, modes 4 and 5 behave the same
			as modes 2 and 3 when FLT_ROUNDS != 1.
		6-9 ==> Debugging modes similar to mode - 4:  don't try
			fast floating-point estimate (if applicable).

		Values of mode other than 0-9 are treated as mode 0.

		Sufficient space is allocated to the return value
		to hold the suppressed trailing zeros.

 *
 * Modifications:
 *	1. Rather than iterating, we use a simple numeric overestimate
 *	   to determine k = floor(log10(d)).  We scale relevant
 *	   quantities using O(log2(k)) rather than O(k) multiplications.
 *	2. For some modes > 2 (corresponding to ecvt and fcvt), we don't
 *	   try to generate digits strictly left to right.  Instead, we
 *	   compute with fewer bits and propagate the carry if necessary
 *	   when rounding the final digit up.  This is often faster.
 *	3. Under the assumption that input will be rounded nearest,
 *	   mode 0 renders 1e23 as 1e23 rather than 9.999999999999999e22.
 *	   That is, we allow equality in stopping tests when the
 *	   round-nearest rule will give the same floating-point value
 *	   as would satisfaction of the stopping test with strict
 *	   inequality.
 *	4. We remove common factors of powers of 2 from relevant
 *	   quantities.
 *	5. When converting floating-point integers less than 1e16,
 *	   we use floating-point arithmetic rather than resorting
 *	   to multiple-precision integers.
 *	6. When asked to produce fewer than 15 digits, we first try
 *	   to get by with floating-point arithmetic; we resort to
 *	   multiple-precision integer arithmetic only if we cannot
 *	   guarantee that the floating-point calculation has given
 *	   the correctly rounded result.  For k requested digits and
 *	   "uniformly" distributed input, the probability is
 *	   something like 10^(k-15) that we must resort to the Long
 *	   calculation.
 *//* freedtoa(s) must be used to free values s returned by dtoa
 * when MULTIPLE_THREADS is #defined.  It should be used in all cases,
 * but for consistency with earlier versions of dtoa, it is optional
 * when MULTIPLE_THREADS is not defined.

 *	Note that both FLT_ROUNDS and fegetround() are specified by the C99

 * #define MALLOC your_malloc, where your_malloc(n) acts like malloc(n)

 *	mode 3 with thousands of digits requested.)
 * #define Omit_Private_Memory to omit logic (added Jan. 1998) for making
 *	memory allocations from a private pool of memory when possible.
 *	When used, the private pool is PRIVATE_MEM bytes long:  2304 bytes,
 *	unless #defined to be a different length.  This default length
 *	suffices to get rid of MALLOC calls except for unusual cases,
 *	such as decimal-to-binary conversion of a very long string of
 *	digits.  The longest string dtoa can return is about 751 bytes
 *	long.  For conversions by strtod of strings of 800 digits and
 *	all dtoa conversions in single-threaded executions with 8-byte
 *	pointers, PRIVATE_MEM >= 7400 appears to suffice; with 4-byte
 *	pointers, PRIVATE_MEM >= 7112 appears adequate.
 * #define NO_INFNAN_CHECK if you do not wish to have INFNAN_CHECK
 *	#defined automatically on IEEE systems.  On such systems,

 *	for Infinity and NaN (case insensitively).  On some systems
 *	(e.g., some HP systems), it may be necessary to #define NAN_WORD0
 *	appropriately -- to the most significant word of a quiet NaN.
 *	(On HP Series 700/800 machines, -DNAN_WORD0=0x7ff40000 works.)
 *	When INFNAN_CHECK is #defined and No_Hex_NaN is not #defined,
 *	strtod also accepts (case insensitively) strings of the form
 *	NaN(x), where x is a string of hexadecimal digits and spaces;
 *	if there is only one string of hexadecimal digits, it is taken
 *	for the 52 fraction bits of the resulting NaN; if there are two
 *	or more strings of hex digits, the first is for the high 20 bits,
 *	the second and subsequent for the low 32 bits, with intervening
 *	white space ignored; but if this results in none of the 52

 *	multiple threads.  In this case, you must provide (or suitably
 *	#define) two locks, acquired by ACQUIRE_DTOA_LOCK(n) and freed
 *	by FREE_DTOA_LOCK(n) for n = 0 or 1.  (The second lock, accessed
 *	in pow5mult, ensures lazy evaluation of only one copy of high
 *	powers of 5; omitting this lock would introduce a small
 *	probability of wasting memory, but would otherwise be harmless.)
 *	You must also invoke freedtoa(s) to free the value s returned by
 *	dtoa.  You may do so whether or not MULTIPLE_THREADS is #defined.
 * #define NO_IEEE_Scale to disable new (Feb. 1997) logic in strtod that
 *	avoids underflows on inputs whose result does not underflow.
 *	If you #define NO_IEEE_Scale on a machine that uses IEEE-format
 *	floating-point numbers and flushes underflows to zero rather
 *	than implementing gradual underflow, then you must also #define
 *	Sudden_Underflow.
 * #define USE_LOCALE to use the current locale's decimal_point value.
 * #define SET_INEXACT if IEEE arithmetic is being used and extra
 *	computation should be done to set the inexact flag when the
 *	result is inexact and avoid setting inexact when the result
 *	is exact.  In this case, dtoa.c must be compiled in
 *	an environment, perhaps provided by #include "dtoa.c" in a
 *	suitable wrapper, that defines two functions,
 *		int get_inexact(void);
 *		void clear_inexact(void);
 *	such that get_inexact() returns a nonzero value if the
 *	inexact bit is already set, and clear_inexact() sets the
 *	inexact bit to 0.  When SET_INEXACT is #defined, strtod
 *	also does extra computations to set the underflow and overflow
 *	flags when appropriate (i.e., when the result is tiny and
 *	inexact or when it is a numeric value rounded to +-infinity).
 * #define NO_ERRNO if strtod should not assign errno = ERANGE when
 *	the result overflows to +-Infinity or underflows to 0.
 * #define NO_HEX_FP to omit recognition of hexadecimal floating-point
 *	values by strtod.
 * #define NO_STRTOD_BIGCOMP (on IEEE-arithmetic systems only for now)
 *	to disable logic for "fast" testing of very long input strings
 *	to strtod.  This testing proceeds by initially truncating the
 *	input string, then if necessary comparing the whole string with
 *	a decimal expansion to decide close cases. This logic is only
 *	used for input more than STRTOD_DIGLIM digits long (default 40).
 *//* strtod for IEEE-, VAX-, and IBM-arithmetic machines.
 * (Note that IEEE arithmetic is disabled by gcc's -ffast-math flag.)
 *
 * This strtod returns a nearest machine number to the input decimal
 * string (or sets errno to ERANGE).  With IEEE arithmetic, ties are
 * broken by the IEEE round-even rule.  Otherwise ties are broken by
 * biased rounding (add half and chop).
 *
 * Inspired loosely by William D. Clinger's paper "How to Read Floating
 * Point Numbers Accurately" [Proc. ACM SIGPLAN '90, pp. 92-101].
 *
 * Modifications:
 *
 *	1. We only require IEEE, IBM, or VAX double-precision
 *		arithmetic (not IEEE double-extended).
 *	2. We get by with floating-point arithmetic in a case that
 *		Clinger missed -- when we're computing d * 10^n
 *		for a small integer d and the integer n is not too
 *		much larger than 22 (the maximum integer k for which
 *		we can represent 10^k exactly), we may be able to
 *		compute (d*10^k) * 10^(e-k) with just one roundoff.
 *	3. Rather than a bit-at-a-time adjustment of the binary
 *		result in the hard case, we use floating-point
 *		arithmetic to determine the adjustment to within
 *		one bit; only in really hard cases do we need to
 *		compute a second residual.
 *	4. Because of 3., we don't need a large table of powers of 10
 *		for ten-to-e (just some small tables, e.g. of 10^k
 *		for 0 <= k <= 22).
 *//* On a machine with IEEE extended-precision registers, it is
 * necessary to specify double-precision (53-bit) rounding precision
 * before invoking strtod or dtoa.  If the machine uses (the equivalent
 * of) Intel 80x87 arithmetic, the call
 *	_control87(PC_53, MCW_PC);
 * does this with many compilers.  Whether this or another call is
 * appropriate depends on the compiler; for this to work, it may be
 * necessary to #include "float.h" or another system-dependent header
 * file.

Usage:	%s [options] <jq filter> [file...]
	%s [options] --args <jq filter> [strings...]
	%s [options] --jsonargs <jq filter> [JSON_TEXTS...]

jq is a tool for processing JSON inputs, applying the given filter to
its JSON text inputs and producing the filter's results as JSON on
standard output.

The simplest filter is ., which copies jq's input to its output
unmodified (except for formatting, but note that IEEE754 is used
for number representation internally, with all that that implies).

For more advanced filters see the jq(1) manpage ("man jq")
and/or https://stedolan.github.io/jq

Example:

	$ echo '{"foo": 0}' | jq .
	{
		"foo": 0
	}

     that yytoken be updated with the new translation.  We take the
     approach of translating immediately before every use of yytoken.
     One alternative is translating here after every semantic action,
     but that translation would be missed if the semantic action invokes
     YYABORT, YYACCEPT, or YYERROR immediately after altering yychar or
     if it invokes YYBACKUP.  In the case of YYABORT or YYACCEPT, an
     incorrect destructor might then be invoked immediately.  In the
     case of YYERROR or YYBACKUP, subsequent parser actions might lead
     to an incorrect destructor call or verbose syntax error message
     before the lookahead is translated.  *//* yacc.c:1646  */// impossible symbol// don't have to free so much stuff here// XXX Make gen_import take only blocks and the int is_data so we//$$ = BLOCK(gen_op_target(FORK_OPT, $2), $2, gen_op_simple(BACKTRACK));//$$ = BLOCK(gen_op_target(FORK_OPT, $2), $2, $4);/* Default location.  *//* If YYLEN is nonzero, implement the default value of the action:

     Otherwise, the following line sets YYVAL to garbage.
     This behavior is undocumented and Bison
     users should not rely upon it.  Assigning to YYVAL

             YYCHECK.  In other words, skip the first -YYN actions for
             this state because they are default actions.  *//* There are many possibilities here to consider:
     - If this state is a consistent state with a default action, then
       the only way this function was invoked is if the default action
       is an error action.  In that case, don't check for expected
       tokens because there are none.
     - The only way there can be no lookahead present (in yychar) is if
       this state is a consistent state with a default action.  Thus,
       detecting the absence of a lookahead is sufficient to determine
       that there is no unexpected or expected token to report.  In that
       case, just report a simple "syntax error".
     - Don't assume there isn't a lookahead just because this state is a
       consistent state with a default action.  There might have been a
       previous inconsistent state, consistent state with a non-default
       action, or user semantic action that manipulated yychar.
     - Of course, the expected token list depends on states to have
       correct lookahead information, and it depends on the parser not
       to perform extra reductions after fetching a lookahead from the
       scanner and before detecting a syntax error.  Thus, state merging
       (from LALR or IELR) and default reductions corrupt the expected
       token list.  However, the list is correct for canonical LR with
       one exception: it will still contain any token that will not be
       accepted due to an error action in a later state.
  *//* Number of reported tokens (one for the "unexpected", one per
     "expected"). *//* Arguments of yyformat. *//* Internationalized format string. *//* Copy into *YYMSG, which is of size *YYMSG_ALLOC, an error message
   about the unexpected token YYTOKEN for the state stack whose top is
   YYSSP.

   Return 0 if *YYMSG was successfully written.  Return 1 if *YYMSG is
   not large enough to hold the message.  In that case, also set
   *YYMSG_ALLOC to the required number of bytes.  Return 2 if the
   required number of bytes is too large to store.  *//* Copy to YYRES the contents of YYSTR after stripping away unnecessary
   quotes and backslashes, so that it's suitable for yyerror.  The
   heuristic is that double-quoting is unnecessary unless the string
   contains an apostrophe, a comma, or backslash (other than
   backslash-backslash).  YYSTR is taken from yytname.  If YYRES is
   null, do not copy; instead, return the length of what the result
   would have been.  *//* Copy YYSRC to YYDEST, returning the address of the terminating '\0' in
   YYDEST.  *//* Return the length of YYSTR.  *//* YYMAXDEPTH -- maximum size the stacks can grow to (effective only
   if the built-in stack extension method is used).

   Do not make this value too large; the results are undefined if

 * Query request/result mask for statx() and struct statx::stx_mask.
 *
 * These bits should be set in the mask argument of statx() to request
 * particular items when calling statx().
 *//* 0x100 *//* Spare space for future expansion *//* 0xa0 *//* 0x90 *//* ID of device containing file [uncond] *//* Device ID of special file [if bdev/cdev] *//* 0x80 *//* Last data modification time *//* Last attribute change time *//* File creation time *//* Last access time *//* 0x40 *//* Mask to show what's supported in stx_attributes *//* Number of 512-byte blocks allocated *//* File size *//* Inode number *//* 0x20 *//* File mode *//* Group ID of owner *//* User ID of owner *//* Number of hard links *//* 0x10 *//* Flags conveying information about the file [uncond] *//* Preferred general I/O size [uncond] *//* What results were written [uncond] *//* 0x00 *//*
 * Structures for the extended file attribute retrieval system call
 * (statx()).
 *
 * The caller passes a mask of what they're specifically interested in as a
 * parameter to statx().  What statx() actually got will be indicated in
 * st_mask upon return.
 *
 * For each bit in the mask argument:
 *
 * - if the datum is not supported:
 *
 *   - the bit will be cleared, and
 *
 *   - the datum will be set to an appropriate fabricated value if one is
 *     available (eg. CIFS can take a default uid and gid), otherwise
 *
 *   - the field will be cleared;
 *
 * - otherwise, if explicitly requested:
 *
 *   - the datum will be synchronised to the server if AT_STATX_FORCE_SYNC is
 *     set or if the datum is considered out of date, and
 *
 *   - the field will be filled in and the bit will be set;
 *
 * - otherwise, if not requested, but available in approximate form without any
 *   effort, it will be filled in anyway, and the bit will be set upon return
 *   (it might not be up to date, however, and no attempt will be made to
 *   synchronise the internal state first);
 *
 * - otherwise the field and the bit will be cleared before returning.
 *
 * Items in STATX_BASIC_STATS may be marked unavailable on return, but they
 * will have values installed for compatibility purposes so that stat() and
 * co. can be emulated in userspace.
 *//*
 * Timestamp structure for the timestamps in struct statx.
 *
 * tv_sec holds the number of seconds before (negative) or after (positive)
 * 00:00:00 1st January 1970 UTC.
 *
 * tv_nsec holds a number of nanoseconds (0..999,999,999) after the tv_sec time.
 *
 * __reserved is held in case we need a yet finer resolution.

 * FALLOC_FL_UNSHARE_RANGE is used to unshare shared blocks within the
 * file size without overwriting any existing data. The purpose of this
 * call is to preemptively reallocate any blocks that are subject to
 * copy-on-write.
 *
 * Different filesystems may implement different limitations on the
 * granularity of the operation. Most will limit operations to filesystem
 * block size boundaries, but this boundary may be larger or smaller
 * depending on the filesystem and/or the configuration of the filesystem
 * or file.
 *
 * This flag can only be used with allocate-mode fallocate, which is
 * to say that it cannot be used with the punch, zero, collapse, or
 * insert range modes.
 *//*
 * FALLOC_FL_INSERT_RANGE is use to insert space within the file size without
 * overwriting any existing data. The contents of the file beyond offset are
 * shifted towards right by len bytes to create a hole.  As such, this
 * operation will increase the size of the file by len bytes.
 *
 * Different filesystems may implement different limitations on the granularity
 * of the operation. Most will limit operations to filesystem block size
 * boundaries, but this boundary may be larger or smaller depending on
 * the filesystem and/or the configuration of the filesystem or file.
 *
 * Attempting to insert space using this flag at OR beyond the end of
 * the file is considered an illegal operation - just use ftruncate(2) or
 * fallocate(2) with mode 0 for such type of operations.
 *//*
 * FALLOC_FL_ZERO_RANGE is used to convert a range of file to zeros preferably
 * without issuing data IO. Blocks should be preallocated for the regions that
 * span holes in the file, and the entire range is preferable converted to
 * unwritten extents - even though file system may choose to zero out the
 * extent or do whatever which will result in reading zeros from the range
 * while the range remains allocated for the file.
 *
 * This can be also used to preallocate blocks past EOF in the same way as
 * with fallocate. Flag FALLOC_FL_KEEP_SIZE should cause the inode
 * size to remain the same.
 *//*
 * FALLOC_FL_COLLAPSE_RANGE is used to remove a range of a file
 * without leaving a hole in the file. The contents of the file beyond
 * the range being removed is appended to the start offset of the range
 * being removed (i.e. the hole that was punched is "collapsed"),
 * resulting in a file layout that looks like the range that was
 * removed never existed. As such collapsing a range of a file changes
 * the size of the file, reducing it by the same length of the range
 * that has been removed by the operation.
 *
 * Different filesystems may implement different limitations on the
 * granularity of the operation. Most will limit operations to
 * filesystem block size boundaries, but this boundary may be larger or
 * smaller depending on the filesystem and/or the configuration of the
 * filesystem or file.
 *
 * Attempting to collapse a range that crosses the end of the file is
 * considered an illegal operation - just use ftruncate(2) if you need
 * to collapse a range that crosses EOF.
